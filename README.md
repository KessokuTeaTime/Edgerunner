# Edgerunner

**Edgerunner** brings back the feature of
*receiving effects according to the block right below the player's feet instead of the actual block the player is standing on,*
which was reported in [`MC-1133`](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-1133)
and fixed in [`23w18a`](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/15447880761997-Minecraft-Java-Edition-23w18a).

Basically, in `23w18a` and above,
you can't eliminate the effects of standing on *soul sand* or *ice* by sneaking on the edge of the block anymore.

It was indeed a bug which has lasted for over 10 years,
but it was also interesting enough that many players see it as a feature and don't want it to be fixed nor removed.

So, here it is again.
